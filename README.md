Classiq-AztecHacks-2024-Quantum-Hackathon

This notebook (algorithms) implements the W3 Werner state.
It is a superposition of all states that have only 1 qubit
set to 1 with the rest being 0. It uses a sequence of CNOTs followed by NOTs. It yields the states '001' (=1), '010' (=2) and '100' (=4) in superposition.

The notebook "challenge-functions" implements largely arithmetic functions using the Classiq SDK.
